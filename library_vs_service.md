What are the differences and when to use which development structure. 

### Overview

When developing software there is a principle called **[DRY](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161)** -- **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself.  This principle is important because duplicated code often means more code to maintained then needed. 
When you need to fix a bug, you need to fix it in all duplicated places and if you need to extend capabilities, you need to do it in multiple parts of the code. This can slow development speed and ultimately cause unwanted complexitiy. 
When a developer adjusts one part of the duplicated code and forgets to adjust the other places, the situation gets more complicated. 

The two options we have to keep our code DRY is to put the shared code in a **library** or put it in a **service**.
